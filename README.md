CppAwait
========

CppAwait is a portable library that brings the await operator from C# 5 to C++. It uses stackful coroutines (_Boost.Context_) instead of compiler magic to get the same job done.



What is await?
==============

In a nutshell, it's a way to compose asynchronous operations in sequential style (as opposed to continuation passing style).

Any algorithm that involves blocking operations can be turned asynchronous while keeping original control flow. This approach is well suited for writing responsive applications that have to deal with laggy network & file I/O.

A more in depth introduction is available on [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh191443.aspx).



How does it work in practice?
=============================

Download and archive some files, allowing for archival while next download is in progress:


    std::vector<std::string> urls = { ... };

    ut::AwaitableHandle awtArchive;

    for (std::string url : urls) {
        // holds fetched document
        std::unique_ptr<std::vector<char> > document;

        ut::AwaitableHandle awtFetch = asyncFetch(url, &document);

        // doesn't block, instead it yields. the coroutine
        // gets resumed when fetch done or on exception.
        awtFetch.await(); 

        if (awtArchive) {
            awtArchive.await();
        }
        awtArchive = asyncArchive(std::move(document));
    }

Features
========

- simple, clear code

- coroutines, wrapped generators

- composable awaitables

- trivial to write custom awaitables

- pluggable into any GUI framework

- exception propagation across coroutines

- good performance with stack pooling

- various logging levels

- portable

- debuggable (break into stacks as usual)



Getting started
===============

1. __Install [Boost](http://www.boost.org/users/download/).__ To use CppAwait you need Boost 1.52+ with _Boost.Context_ and _Boost.System_ compiled [[*]](#msvc10). Quick guide:

   - download Boost archive
   - ./bootstrap
   - ./b2 --build-type=minimal --with-context --with-chrono --with-thread --toolset=your-toolset stage

2. __Install [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html) 2.8+__

3. __Build CppAwait__:

   - mkdir build\_dir ; cd build\_dir
   - cmake -G "your-generator" -DBOOST\_INCLUDEDIR="path-to-boost" -DBOOST\_LIBRARYDIR="path-to-boost-libs" "path-to-CppAwait"
   - open solution / make

<a id="msvc10">(*)</a> Visual C++ 2010 doesn't implement the thread library. In this case _Boost.Chrono_ and _Boost.Thread_ are required to compile the examples. 


Portability
===========

The library is supported on Windows / Linux with any of these compilers:

   - Visual C++ 2010 or later
   - GCC 4.6 or later

Boost.Context includes assembly code for ARM / MIPS / PowerPC32 / PowerPC64 / X86-32 / X86-64.

Porting to additional platforms (e.g. iOS, Android) should be trivial.



How it works
============

### TODO

- describe stackful coroutines

- describe how context switches are orchestrated

- describe lifetime of stacks & awaitables
